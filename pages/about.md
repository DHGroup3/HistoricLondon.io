## About this Collection

"Historic London, ON" maps and images collection is the outcome of a group project for GRADLIS 9372: Digital Humanities and Library and Information Science at Western University. It is a demonstration of Yeliz Baloglu Cengay, Griffin Heaney, and Lia Whalen's expertise with Collection Builder. 

In this collection, we used 10 historic maps of London, ON, which were digitized by Western Libraries' Map and Data Center and hosted as a part of their [Historical Maps of London, ON 1800-1900](https://www.lib.uwo.ca/madgic/histdatatab.html) collection. We added 4 picture albums/view books of London, ON from [Internet Archives](https://archive.org/). Lastly we explored and did hand on research at [Western Libraries Archives and Special Collections](https://www.lib.uwo.ca/archives/index.html) and selected 5 print maps and 1 illustrated atlas of London, ON. After the digitization process, they were alos added to the collection.

We used iPhoneXs iOs 16.6 and Scanner Pro Version 8.16 application to digitize the archival materials.
