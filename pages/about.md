## About this Collection

This collection is a group project for GRADLIS 9372: Digital Humanities and Library and Information Science at Western University. It is a demonstration of Yeliz Baloglu Cengay, Griffin Heaney, and Lia Whalen's expertise with Collection Builder.


## The Project

Learn about, apply, and build a digital humanities project using one of several tools.
The goal is to work together to investigate a new tool and build a project using mock data. A
short presentation will be required (5 minutes).
Learning Objectives:
• Collaboratively explore and gain proficiency with a digital humanities tool or application.
• Develop the ability to teach and communicate complex concepts effectively.
• Analyze the theoretical and practical relevance of the chosen tool within the field of digital
humanities.
